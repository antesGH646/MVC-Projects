service package includes all the interfaces and their implementing classes
that deal with the business logic(user stories or customer requirements)
The logic that we use in the Controllers comes from the services.
1) write the business logic as abstract methods in interfaces
2) create implementing classes
Services interact with:
 - the DTO classes
 - the services implementing classes
 - the controller
 - the repository classes
