entity package is some times called model, it is the same thing.
Most companies name it entity. This package occupies the classes that
deal/connects with the mappers and repository classes, and the database
During the discussion, you will be given what type of entity attributes to include

You might not want to display to the UI all the data that come from the database.
Some data might be unnecessary such as updated date inserted date , etc. This is database
specific. To display the data from the database into the UI you need mappers. Mappers take the
the data and convert it into dto. Then dto map them into the Controller.

Though dto and entity have the same classes, but some attributes that come from the database
might not be needed in the UI. That is why we have two separate packages.

Note that: if a class is extending another class, lombok will not create a constructor for you
therefore you need to create the constructor manually.
