dto package occupies similar class as the entity or model package, but it do not interact with
the database. It interacts with the services, mappers, and the controllers
The data that you display on the UI comes from the dto fields.

Note that: if a class is extending another class, lombok will not create a constructor for you
therefore you need to create the constructor manually.
